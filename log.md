# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: December 20, 2020


**Today's Progress**: Preparing environment: 
* updated Windows to latest feature update
* installed WSL2
* installed OpenSuse (I already use Ubuntu at work so it's time for a change)
* installed rbenv, Ruby, git, etc ...

**Thoughts:** wanted to start early but my body said no so I've been sleeping half of the day thanks to a headache

**Link to work:** RDP into my laptop to see the results ;)
