# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: December 20, 2020


**Today's Progress**: Preparing environment: 
* updated Windows to latest feature update
* installed ~~WSL2~~ WSL (apparently WSL2 doesn't work with my Comodo Firewall though a patch is on it's way I'll just start with WSL which also works pretty well)
* installed OpenSuse (I already use Ubuntu at work so it's time for a change)
* installed rbenv, Ruby, git, etc ...

**Thoughts:** Wanted to start early but my body said no so I've been sleeping half of the day thanks to a headache. TIL that there's an ed25519 algorithm to generate SSH keys.

**Link to work:**  Some usefull links I used
